		  <title>Halal Pho</title>
		  <description>Pho is a traditional Vietnamese soup consisting of broth, rice noodles, herbs, and meat. This Halal version of pho is both easy to make and healthy, offering a nutritious and delicious meal option.</description>
		  <by>Ahmad Tran</by>
		  <preptime>Approx. 30 minutes (excluding broth simmering time)</preptime>
		  <kcal>Approx. 350-400 kcal per serving</kcal>
	  
			<ingredients>
				<item>As many beef bones / chicken bones that you can lay your hands on</item>
				<item>1 whole onion (peeled)</item>
				<item>1 piece of flattened ginger</item>
				<item>Beef stock (2-4 cubes)</item>
				<item>A dash of salt</item>
				<item>1 tablespoon fish sauce</item>
				<item>A handful of coriander</item>
				<item>300-400g flat rice noodles / egg noodles</item>
				<item>500g beef</item>
				<item>(Optional): A handful of cinnamon sticks and cloves if desired</item>
				<item>Red poblano peppers, spring onions, lime and beansprouts to serve</item>
			</ingredients>
		  
		  <instructions>
				<step>Place the beef bones / chicken bones in a separate pot to the one you will use for your final Pho. Fleshy bits of bones will work best. Boil the bones for around 10 minutes to remove any impurities.</step>
				<step>Dump the water in the sink, rinse the bones, and transfer them to a large, clean pot of boiling water (1.5-2 litres) in which you will make your Pho.</step>
				<step>Using a pair of tongs, char the ginger and the onion over an open flame. Add the onion (unchopped), and the ginger to the Pho pot, along with the beef stock, salt, and fish sauce.</step>
				<step>Simmer the broth on a low to medium heat. The longer you simmer the broth, the more flavours you’ll extract. (Traditional beef Pho takes anywhere between 4 to 12 hours, but here, 1.5 – 2 hours should suffice). Remove any foam/scum that floats to the top.</step>
				<step>In a separate pot, add boiling water and a tablespoon of olive oil, and cook the noodles until they are soft.</step>
				<step>In the last half an hour of your target soup-simmer time, add a handful of coriander and if desired, cinnamon sticks and cloves.</step>
				<step>Cut the beef into thin, flat slices. You do not need to simmer them in the broth as they will cook through within seconds of coming into contact with the boiling Pho. (Simmering them in the soup for anything longer than thirty seconds will almost certainly result in tough, overcooked pieces of meat, which better resemble tyre shreddings than they do beef).</step>
				<step>Plate up the noodles in separate bowls, and place the beef slices on top. Add slices of red poblano peppers, spring onions, lime and beansprouts, and any other vegetation that you desire.</step>
				<step>Remove the bones and aromatics from the soup, and pour it into the bowls. Cover the beef slices / stir them around, and you’ll see that they will cook right through.</step>
				<step>Finally – tuck in and enjoy a steamy, beefy, guilt-free broth!</step>

		  <by>Shah Nawab</by>
		  <preptime>15-20 minutes</preptime>
		  <kcal>150-200 kcal per piece</kcal>
	  
		  <ingredients>
				<item>For the Gulab Jamun Balls:</item>
				<item>1 cup milk powder</item>
				<item>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</item>
				<item>1/4 cup ghee (clarified butter) or butter</item>
				<item>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</item>
				<item>2-3 tablespoons milk (as needed to form dough)</item>
				<item>2 cups sugar</item>
				<item>2 cups water</item>
				<item>4-5 cardamom pods, crushed</item>
				<item>1 tablespoon rose water or a few drops of rose essence</item>
				<item>A few saffron strands (optional)</item>
		  </ingredients>
	  
		  <instructions>
			<step>In a large saucepan, combine sugar and water. Heat over medium flame, stirring occasionally until the sugar dissolves completely. Add the crushed cardamom pods and saffron strands (if using). Allow the syrup to boil for 5-7 minutes until it becomes slightly sticky. The syrup should not be too thick. Turn off the heat and add rose water or rose essence. Keep the syrup warm.</step>
			<step>In a mixing bowl, combine milk powder, all-purpose flour, and baking soda. Add ghee or butter to the dry mixture and mix well. Gradually add milk, one tablespoon at a time, and knead gently to form a soft, smooth dough. The dough should not be too dry or too sticky. Let the dough rest for 5-10 minutes.</step>
			<step>Divide the dough into small equal portions and roll them into smooth, crack-free balls. Heat oil or ghee in a deep frying pan over low-medium heat. Gently slide the balls into the hot oil, frying them in batches. The balls should rise slowly to the surface. If they rise too quickly, the oil is too hot. Fry the balls, gently stirring them to ensure even browning, until they turn golden brown. Remove the fried balls with a slotted spoon and drain the excess oil on paper towels.</step>
			<step>While still warm, gently place the fried balls into the warm sugar syrup. Let the Gulab Jamun soak in the syrup for at least 1-2 hours. They will double in size as they absorb the syrup.</step>

		  <ingredients>
				<item>Ingredients (makes 2 large pancakes):</item>
				<item>120g all-purpose flour</item>
				<item>30g cornstarch or potato starch</item>
				<item>¼ teaspoon salt</item>
				<item>¼ teaspoon baking powder</item>
				<item>¼ teaspoon sugar</item>
				<item>4 eggs, beaten</item>
				<item>½ large head of cabbage (about 500g), finely chopped</item>
				<item>½ cup (125ml) of dashi (Japanese soup stock)</item>
				<item>1 small bunch of scallions/spring onions, sliced</item>
				<item>150g of boneless chicken or seafood, cut into small pieces</item>
				<item>For the topping/garnish:</item>
				<item>Kewpie Japanese mayonnaise</item>

				<item>Bonito flakes</item>
				<item>Sliced spring onion</item>
				<item>Beni shoga (Japanese red pickled ginger) (optional)</item>
		  </ingredients>
	  
		  <instructions>
				<step>To a large bowl, add the flour, salt, sugar, whisk together. Add the beaten eggs and dashi. Mix until just combined.</step>
				<step>Add the chopped cabbage and sliced scallions and mix until combined.</step>
				<step>Heat a frying pan over medium heat. Add some oil to lightly coat the bottom of the pan or use cooking spray.</step>
				<step>When the frying pan is hot, ladle out nearly half the okonomiyaki batter onto the centre of the pan, then spread it out into a circle (the okonomiyaki should be roughly 2cm in thickness).</step>
				<step>Place your chicken or seafood evenly on the pancake. Season lightly with some salt. Drizzle a bit more of the batter on the pancake over the meat/seafood (just to help it adhere and not fall out when you flip the pancake over).</step>
				<step>Cover the pan and let it cook for about 5 minutes until the pancake is golden brown on the bottom.</step>
				<step>Flip the pancake over - you can use two spatulas (each supporting half of the pancake), or you can also slide the okonomiyaki out onto a plate, then place your pan over your plate and flip the pancake back into the pan.</step>
				<step>Cover again and let cook for another 5 minutes.</step>
				<step>Flip the okonomiyaki one more time and let it cook for another couple of minutes. Check that the fillings are cooked and the pancake is cooked through (you can use a chopstick to poke through the centre of the pancake - if it comes out clean then it's ready.</step>
				<step>Transfer the pancake to a plate. Repeat with the rest of the batter.</step>
				<step>Drizzle over with okonomiyaki sauce, mayonnaise and bonito flakes. Serve immediately.</step>
